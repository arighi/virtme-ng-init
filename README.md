# virtme-ng-init: fast init process for virtme-ng

virtme-ng-init is an extremely lightweight init process for virtme-ng [1]
implemented in Rust.

Its primary goal is to speed up the boot time of virtme-ng instances.

virtme-ng-init is able to perform any necessary initialization in the
virtualized environment, such as mounting filesystems, starting essential
services, and configuring the system before handing over control to the main
user-space processes (typicall a shell session).

# Building

Static building is necessary as this binary is going to be executed
before the file system is up and running.

```
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+crt-static' cargo build -r
```

# Local installation

Put the binary into virtme/guest/bin/.
e.g. when used as a submodule:
```
cp target/release/virtme-ng-init ../virtme/guest/bin
```
